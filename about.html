              A Glimpse into the Past
            </h2>
            <strong>Spanish period</strong>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">
              The city of Ozamiz grew out of an old Spanish town called
              Misamis—a name believed to have been derived from the Subanen word
              kuyamis, a variety of coconut. Other unverified historical
              sources, however, suggest that the name Misamis came from the
              Spanish word Misa (Catholic Mass).
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
              The old Spanish town grew in size due to the nearby Spanish
              garrison stationed at the stone fort named Fuerte de la Concepcion
              y del Triunfo. The fort was constructed some time in 1756 in order
              to attempt to combat the pirate activities originating in the
              nearby Lanao area. In 1850, the town of Misamis became the capital
              of the District of Misamis until during the 1870s, when the
              capital was transferred to Cagayan de Oro.

            <strong>American period and World War II</strong>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
              During the American occupation, the territory was reduced when
              Governor-General Francis Burton Harrison issued Executive Order
              No. 61, series of 1920; the barrios, which was once part of the
              former municipality of Loculan, were separated and organized into
              new municipalities of Clarin and Tudela. In October 1942, Wendell
              Fertig established the command headquarters of the growing
              guerrilla resistance to the Japanese occupation of Mindanao in the
              Spanish fort in the city. His headquarters was abandoned June 26,
              1943, due to a large Japanese attack. Until the end of the war,
              the Japanese occupied this fort. During the Japanese occupation of
              Misamis in World War II, the fort was garrisoned by a contingent
              of Japanese who dug foxholes near or under the walls. This
              undermining of walls later led to the destruction of the southwest
              bastion in the earthquake of 1955.

            <strong>Contemporary Period</strong>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
              After the war, Misamis became a chartered city by virtue of
              Republic Act 321 on July 16, 1948. This also renamed Misamis to
              Ozamiz, after the hero José Ozámiz who hailed from the province of
              Misamis Occidental and who at one time also served as its first
              governor and congressional representative of the Lone District of
              Misamis Occidental, a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional
              Convention that resulted in the creation of the 1935 Constitution
              for the Philippine Commonwealth Government. In 1941, José Ozámiz
              was elected to the Philippine Senate. On February 25, 2000, three
              Super Five Transport buses aboard the M/V Our Lady of Mediatrix
              ferry exploded while the ferry was traveling from Kolambugan,
              Lanao del Norte to the Port of Ozamiz. The reason for the
              explosion was the use of large incendiary bombs, resulting in 44
              deaths and more than 100 passengers wounded. On July 30, 2017, the
              Criminal Investigation and Detection Group and the Ozamiz City
              Police raided the house of incumbent Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog Sr.
              where guns were allegedly stored, resulting in the deaths of 16
              people, including Mayor Parojinog, his wife Susan, and two of his
              siblings. The raid also ended with the mayor's children, incumbent
              Vice Mayor Nova Princess Parojinog-Echavez and Reynaldo Parojinog
              Jr., being arrested. This incident was part of the War on Drugs
              campaign during President Rodrigo Duterte's administration.
